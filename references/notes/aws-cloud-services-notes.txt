Cloud Computing Basics
	- What is Cloud Computing
	- Cloud Computing Architecture
	- Cloud Computing Characteristics
	- Cloud Service Models - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
	- Cloud Deployment Models - Private, Public, Hybrid, Community
	- Benefits and Limitations
	
Cloud Service Providers
	- AWS Services
	- Azure
	- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

AWS Services
	- AWS Global Infrastructure - Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations
	- Core Services - Compute, Storage, Networking
	- Extended Core Services - CDN, Security
	- Platform Services - Database, Analytics, AI/ML, Mobile, IoT, 
	- Deployment & Management Services - CloudFormation, OpsWorks, System Manager, etc.

			Tenancy
				Shared
				Dedicated Instance
				Dedicated Host
				
			Purchasing Options
				- On Demand (hourly charges) | shared/multi-tenant
				- Reserved	(Long term usage) | shared/multi-tenant
				- Spot Instances (Short term usage) | shared/multi-tenant  | cheapest
				- Dedicated Instance (Single tenant hardware)
				- Dedicated Host (Separate server for each EC2) | costliest

	- Steps to create EC2 instance
		Step 1: Select AMI (Template with OS, apps, config, etc..)
		Step 2: Choose Instance Types (General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage optimized, GPU instances)
		Step 3: Configure Instance
					- No of instances
					- Networking (VPC)
					- Placement Groups (how instances to be placed in the underlying hardware)
						- cluster (low latency instance communication)
						- partition (distributed computing / workload)
						- spread (more isolation b/w instances)
						
					- Tenancy (Shared / Dedicated)
		Step 4: Storage (EBS)
					- storage size
					- storage type (ssd/magnetic)
					- encryption
					
		Step 5: Configure Security Groups
					- inbound traffic rules
					- outbound traffic rules
					
		Step 6: Add tags
					- metadata
					- logical group instances
					- filtering
					
		Step 7: configure Key Pair (credentials)
